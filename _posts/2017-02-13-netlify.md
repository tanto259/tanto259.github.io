When I first heard about <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a>, I couldn't believe they are real. Providing free plan is not cheap, yet they even went as far as providing a free Open Source and Non Profit plan. Interested with their service, I signed up and migrate my site from GitHub Pages. Almost immediately, I fell in love with them.

Compared with the SSL-less (on custom domain) GitHub Pages, <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a> provide a free SSL certificate with a push of a button. Setting up settings for my site deployment is also easy, I only need to attach <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a> with my GitHub Repo and simply let Netlify take care of the rest.

### What I loved about Netlify

* Netlify served my site from a global CDN, providing the optimal uptime.
* Automatic and fast deploys from a Git repo.
* Free SSL
* Rollback your site as far as you'd like with a click of a button.
* Awesome Redirects Rule
* Custom HTTP Headers
* Form Submission which I used for my contact form.
* Free custom domains with aliases.
* DNS Hosting for paid and open source plan.

### HTTP Headers, Redirects and SSL

**Headers**

Being a fan for security, I immediately interested in using those Headers. To use the feature, all you need is a <code>_headers</code> file in the root folder of your repo.
```
\*
	X-Frame-Options: DENY
	X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
	X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```
This settings would provide an optimal security for your Netlify site. If you are a fanatic of security, add the following line:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Public-Key-Pins: pin-sha256="cert1pin"; pin-sha256="cert2pin"; includeSubDomains; max-age=5184000
```

**Avoid using the Public-Key-Pins headers if you do not know what you are doing. Wrong moves can prevent access to your site for the max-age period. If you do use HPKP, you should know that your site sha256 pin will change when Netlify renew the certificate. You should pin Let's Encrypt Intermediate or/and Root instead, also pin another CA root for backup.**

You should explore more about Content-Security-Policy in order to further improve your site security. Once you figured out CSP, change it to a better policy. See <a href="https://github.com/tanto259/tanto259.github.io/blob/master/_headers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mine</a> for reference.

More about headers at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/headers-and-basic-auth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the documentation page</a>. Netlify only allows Headers on their paid or open source plan.

**Redirects**

Netlify also provide an amazing redirects rule, you just add <code>_redirects</code> file in the root folder of your repo.

Then, add the code like the example below:
```
\oldpost		\newpost				301!
\*			\maintenance				503!
\tyoplink		\typolink				301!
\apples\*		\apples\index.html			200!

# This indicates a comment
# Original Link - New Link - HTTP Status Code
```
Netlify will by default prevent URL shadowing. For example:
```
\*		\anotherlink		301
```
The path <code>\more\new.html</code> would still renders. To prevent this from happening add an exclamation mark to the HTML status code (<code>301</code> to <code>301!</code>).

**SSL**

All you need to activate SSL is to click the green button. Yes.. seriously, it is that simple.
![netlify ssl]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/data/netlifyssl.png)

### Netlify is simply amazing

With <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a> you can host your site with ease and comfort knowing they are safe.

This is not a sponsored writing, I simply write about this since I love their service.
