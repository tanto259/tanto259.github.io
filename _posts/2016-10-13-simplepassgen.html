<div id="faq">
	<br/>
	<p><b>1. Why is the app in beta?</b></p>
	<p>The app has not been tested thoroughly. If you are an expert, and wanted to help or test it, don't hesitate to contact me or submit an issue on GitHub.</p>
	
	<p><b>2. How to use it?</b></p>
	<p>First, enter your email address. Then enter the password hosts, or where you wanted to use the password. Afterwards, enter the password version. Then enter your unique passphrase and press the button. Your new password is on the fifth field.</p>
	
	<p><b>3. Why do you need my email?</b></p>
	<p>Your email are used as a key in the HMAC process. We do not store your email.</p>
	
	<p><b>4. I entered the same code as before, but it resulted in a different password!</b></p>
	<p>Please ensure that you are using the exactly same code. All field is CASE-SENSITIVE. If you forget one of the field, you cannot recover your password?</p>
	
	<p><b>5. I haven't enter anything but there are already a password there.</b></p>
	<p><i>OWIzYTdkMGY0Nzk4</i> is the plain password. DO NOT USE IT.</p>
	
	<p><b>6. Who are you, why should I trust you?</b></p>
	<p>I'm a high school student with interest in cryptography. If you don't trust me, you can download the file required and run it locally on your browser.</p>
	
	<p><b>7. I found a bug. Where should I report?</b></p>
	<p>Feel free to report it on Github.</p>
	
	<p><b>8. I found a security issue. Where should I report?</b></p>
	<p>Please contact me through <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{{ site.url }}/contact</a>. For issue related with third-party libraries used, please contact the respective author.</p>
	
	<p><b>9. I only filled some of the field and when I clicked the button, it generated a password.</b></p>
	<p>DO NOT USE THE PASSWORD GENERATED IF YOU DID NOT COMPLETE ALL THE FIELD. Those password could be very weak.</p>
	
	<p><b>10. Why do you use SHA3-512?</b></p>
	<p>SHA-2 is designed by the NSA. With all the bad rumour surrounding the agency, it is better to use an algorithm not designed by the agency.</p>
	
	<p><b>11. Is it safe?</b></p>
	<p>That is the million dollar question. I haven't done enough testing to ensure that this is safe, please do not use the password in a production environment. Use the password generated at your own risk.</p>
	
	<p><b>12. How does this work?</b></p>
	<p>First, your password hosts are hashed using SHA3-512 with your password version as its gen number. Then it is used as your scrypt password. Your passphrase then undergo the HMAC process with your email as the key. The result is used as your scrypt salt. Then the scrypt process begin with N=2^14, r=8 and p=1. The result is then processed to Base 64. Then your new generated password is generated with the last number in the string and the 15 digit/words infront of the last number, resulting in your 16-digit password.</p>
	
	<p><b>13. This does not answer my question.</b></p>
