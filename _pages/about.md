In my opinion, one of the most difficult thing to write about is yourself. How do one start? With a Hello? Hi? I never really know what to say.

My name is Hartanto, you can find me on most social media profile using the username tanto259, I love cryptography and anything related to internet security.

You can <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact me here</a> and you can also see <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my social media here</a>.

My PGP key information can be <a href="{{ site.url }}/pgp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found here</a> with a <a href="https://tanto259.keybase.pub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keybase.pub page</a> to verify those keys.
